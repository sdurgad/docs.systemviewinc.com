# Visual System Integrator

Visual System Integrator is the one-of-a-kind tool for embedded development which, for the first time, makes it possible  to develop a full functioning system. Visual System Integrator enables you to define the full system using GUI or through a C++ file. The defined system can span across multiple CPUs, FPGAs and DSPs from different vendors.
Visual System Integrator provides system level instrumentation and trace capabilities throughout the system and across vendor specific tools to reduce time-to-market.
Visual System Integrator provides code import support for popular languages such as C/C++ python and java. By using Visual System Integrator, moving data between these programming languages and even across software/hardware is as simple as drawing a line. The end result is reduced time in repetitive tasks and more time developing features and making your product robust.
